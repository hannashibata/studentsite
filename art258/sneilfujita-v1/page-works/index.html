                    <p>S. Neil Fujita was a dynamic key player in graphic design whose bold, innovative work defined the boundaries between art and commercial design, shaping American graphic design history. He created a new look and feel to jazz album covers such as Dave Brubeck&lsquo;s &ldquo;Time Out,&rdquo; Charles Mingus&lsquo; &ldquo;Mingus Ah Um,&rdquo; and Miles Davis&lsquo; &ldquo;Round About Midnight,&rdquo; as well as iconic book covers such as &ldquo;The Godfather,&rdquo; and &ldquo;In Cold Blood.&rdquo; Born on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, in 1921 as a Japanese-American Nisei, his journey to devoting himself to art and design started when he started his studies in art and design at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles. That journey was not so easy, though. Like many other Japanese-Americans, his life was disrupted by World War 2 and the issue of Executive Order 9066. While these events do not look to overshadow his prolific portfolio, his works reflect Fujita&lsquo;s resilience and fearlessness.</p>
